Changelog
=========

1.4 - 2010-01-20
----------------

- Extend the quoting and dequoting API to make it more (re)usable.
  [stefan]

- Dequoting didn't work right when the default quoting character
  was single quote.
  [stefan]

- Tildes in quoted filenames could cause quotes to be closed even
  if the tilde-expanded name matched a directory.
  [stefan]


1.3 - 2010-01-03
----------------

- Cut down on infrastructure slack in filename completion. The
  individual strategies are very small.

- Add an example session to the README.
  [stefan]


1.2 - 2009-11-24

----------------

- Allow to specify the filename quoting style on the command line
