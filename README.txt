Command line shell for GnuPG

Introduction
============

The **gpgkeys** program is a Python application that allows to conveniently
manage GnuPG keys and keyrings.

While probably not very interesting in itself, it serves as example
application and testbed for the development of the rl_ library.

In particular, gpgkeys contains a sophisticated implementation of
**filename completion**, which may one day find its way into a standalone
package or rl_ add-on.
